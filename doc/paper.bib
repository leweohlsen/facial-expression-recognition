        Learning focused on three challenges: the black box learning challenge,
        the facial expression recognition challenge, and the multimodal learn-
        ing challenge. We describe the datasets created for these challenges and
        summarize the results of the competitions. We provide suggestions for or-
        ganizers of future challenges and some comments on what kind of knowl-
        edge can be gained from machine learning competitions. http://deeplearning.net/icml2013-workshop-competition}
